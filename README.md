# instatracer
Hacked this together yesterday for testing Github-Copilot. But found the idea quite cool. 
Currently i have other projects that have more priority but feel free to fork it :)

## How to use
- Get your api key here [here](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials)
- Go to the config file and put in the needed data it's quite obvious what to do there
- https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials


    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 main.py

## TO-DO Would be cool 
- Visualize coordinates on a real map
- Add an argparser
- Add tests
